<p> </p>
<p>1. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>A. These terms and conditions, as well as any additional terms, conditions and covenants referenced in or made available by hyperlink in this document (collectively, these &quot;Terms&quot; or this &quot;Agreement&quot;), govern Your use of and access to this Website and any and all of its sub-pages (collectively, the &quot;Website&quot;), the services provided through this Website, the purchase, order, or use of Our products, and any communications between You and Divine Health.</p>
<p>B. This Agreement is intended to be governed by the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act. You manifest Your agreement to the terms in this document by any act demonstrating Your assent thereto, including clicking any button containing the words &quot;I agree&quot; or similar syntax, or by merely accessing the Website, whether You have read these terms or not. It is suggested that You print this form for Your personal records.</p>
<p>C. Divine Health reserves the right to revise, amend, or modify this policy and Our other policies and agreements related to the Website at any time and in any manner, without prior notice to You. Accordingly, You should periodically check this page for any modifications of these Terms.</p>
<p>D. If You do not agree to be bound by these Terms, You may not enter, access or use the Website, or purchase or use any products through this Website, and You should exit the Website immediately. By accessing, using or ordering products through the Website, You affirm that You have read this Agreement and understand, agree and consent to all Terms contained herein. You further agree not to use or access Website if doing so would violate the laws of Your state, province or country.</p>
<p>E. At the bottom of this page appears a &quot;last modified&quot; date. If the &quot;last modified&quot; date remains unchanged, then You may presume that no changes have been made since the &quot;last modified&quot; date.

<p> </p>
<p>2. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</p>
<p>You and Divine Health agree that any dispute between us (including disputes against any agent employee, subsidiary, affiliate, predecessor in interest, successor, or assign of the other) relating to Our Website, the services provided through Our Website, any transaction or relationship between us resulting from Your use of Our Website, communications between us, or the purchase, order, or use of Our products, will be resolved exclusively and finally by binding arbitration and the arbitration decision may be enforced and judgment entered thereon in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and Divine Health agree that this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (&quot;FAA&quot;), and not by any state law concerning arbitration. You and Divine Health further agree that any determination regarding the applicability, enforceability, or validity of this arbitration agreement will be made by the arbitrator, not by any court.</p>
<p><strong>BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.</strong> In arbitration, a dispute is resolved by a neutral arbitrator or panel of arbitrators, rather than by a judge or jury. Arbitration is more informal, however, an arbitrator can award the same relief that a court can award. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), and conducted under AAA&rsquo;s Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the &ldquo;AAA Rules&rdquo;) then in effect at the time of the dispute. <strong>You may obtain copies of the AAA Rules and forms and instructions for initiating arbitration by visiting the AAA website at www.adr.org, or by calling AAA at (800) 788-7879.</strong> If you initiate an arbitration, Divine Health will promptly reimburse you for any standard filing fee which may have been required by AAA once you have notified Divine Health in writing and provided a copy of the arbitration proceedings. However, if Divine Health is the prevailing party in the arbitration, applicable law may allow the arbitrator to award attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs to Divine Health. If for any reason the AAA is unavailable, the parties shall mutually select another arbitration forum.</p>
<p>There shall be no right or authority for any claim to be arbitrated on a class action basis or in a purported representative capacity. No claim submitted to arbitration is heard by a jury or may be brought as a private attorney general. You do not have the right to act as a class representative or participate as a member of a class of claimants with respect to any claim submitted to arbitration. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims against Divine Health and may not preside over any kind of representative or class proceeding against Divine Health, its agents, officers, shareholders, members, employees, subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors in interests, successors and/or assigns. You acknowledge that this class action waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any disputes between the parties and is nonseverable from the agreement to arbitrate claims. If any portion of this class action waiver is limited, voided, or cannot be enforced, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void. <strong>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, WHICH CONTAINS THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST Divine Health, ITS AGENTS, OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, MEMBERS, EMPLOYEES, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PREDECESSORS IN INTEREST, SUCCESSORS AND/OR ASSIGNS IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</strong></p>
